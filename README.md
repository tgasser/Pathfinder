# Pathfinder
A Bayesian-inferred simple climate model.


## How-to

Download a release. *Read The Fine Manual.*

Pathfinder has been developed in Python 3.7 and run preferentially through IPython. Currently, packages required to run it are `numpy`, `scipy` and `xarray`, and it has hard-coded dependencies on `pymc3` and `theano` (that are in fact used only for calibration).

This is the first public release, and the readme, manual, and example scripts are expected to evolve. The repository is probably still somewhat messy. Get in touch if you have questions.
